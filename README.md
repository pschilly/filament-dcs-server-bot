This package is a series of widgets, pages and panels for Filament PHP and is loaded as a plugin. It interfaces with the DCS Server Bot API by Special-K to obtain statistics gathered from managed Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) servers.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require pschilly/filament-dcs-server-stats
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not set up a custom theme and are using Filament Panels follow the instructions in the [Filament Docs](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme) first.

After setting up a custom theme add the plugin's views to your theme css file or your app's css file if using the standalone packages.

```css
@source '../../../../vendor/pschilly/filament-dcs-server-stats/resources/**/*.blade.php';
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-dcs-server-stats-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-dcs-server-stats-views"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
];
```
